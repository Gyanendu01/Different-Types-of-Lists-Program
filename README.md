# Different Types of Lists Program

## DESCRIPTION

This is a program that will highlight the similarities and differences
between four different types of lists: a list of strings, a list of integers, a list of floats, and a list of
lists. For each list, this program will describe the data type of the list, the elements of the list,
and the data type of the first element in the list. This program will then highlight the similarities
and differences between sorting a list numerically and alphabetically.
